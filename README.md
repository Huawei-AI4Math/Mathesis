# Mathesis: Towards Formal Theorem Proving from Natural Languages

Most LLM-based theorem provers have long been constrained by the need for expert-written formal statements as inputs, limiting their applicability to real-world problems expressed in natural language. We tackle this gap with **Mathesis**, the first **end-to-end theorem proving** pipeline processing informal problem statements.
- To enhance the formalization ability of natural language problems, we introduce **Mathesis-Autoformalizer**, which is trained using a novel reinforcement learning approach that integrates local alignment via GRPO and global alignment via DPO. We refer to this technique as Hierarchical Preference Optimization.
- We propose **LeanScorer**, a novel evaluation method combining _LLM-based analysis_ with _Sugeno Fuzzy Integral_ for nuanced formalization assessment.
- We also propose a **Mathesis-Prover**, which generates formal proofs from the formalized statements.
- To evaluate the real-world applicability of end-to-end formal theorem proving, we introduce **Gaokao-Formal**, a benchmark of 488 complex problems from China‚Äôs national college entrance exam.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è Ongoing Improvement
This end-to-end theorem proving pipeline marks a significant step forward. We will continue refining our models and techniques to improve performance. For applications requiring strict accuracy, expert review is highly recommended to ensure reliability.

## Mathesis-Autoformalizer
- To formalize mathematical problem statements from natural language into formal Lean 4 code, we introduce Mathesis-Autoformalizer, the first autoformalization model trained with reinforcement learning. It generates syntactically valid and semantically faithful formal statements from natural language, making it well-suited for real-world settings where accurate formalization is critical.

## Leanscorer
- To enable a more fine-grained and reliable assessment, we propose LeanScorer, a novel framework yielding a continuous correctness score (0 to 1). This score allows for dynamic adjustment of decision thresholds according to task-specific precision/recall requirements.
